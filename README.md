Improvements given more time:

1. Mobile scaling with more media queries (started doing it but ran out of time)
2. drop down next to the greeting (didn't manage to do it in time)
3. didn't give the option to sort by source too (only implemented the 2 date sorting methods)
4. Design of the article grid items and the pagination elements need some more refinement too look a bit better but i decided to spend more time in the functional things
5. tidy up the code in more folders for better readability

I would guess that with 1-2 hours extra I would have taken care of all those small issues. Given the time constraints i am satisfied with the result
